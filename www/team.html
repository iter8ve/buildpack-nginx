<p>All of our consultants, associates, and advisors are highly experienced fundraising leaders. They have served as board chairs, philanthropists, presidents, deans, and senior development and advancement officers. We apply the same principles to search and other consulting that we have applied to our work with donors: we create long-term relationships with clients and candidates, building partnerships intended to last throughout a career, not only for the duration of one search or one consulting assignment.</p>
