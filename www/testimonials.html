<blockquote>
<p>“As national leaders in executive search, Aspen Leadership Group
consultants allow organizations and our nation’s most talented,
accomplished, and dedicated professionals to establish mutually
rewarding and fulfilling professional relationships. Under Ron
Schiller’s leadership, as consultants to institutions and their
leaders, they have my highest recommendation.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Don Randel, President Emeritus, Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and
President Emeritus, University of Chicago</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Aspen Leadership Group provided expert direction and execution of
a retreat of college presidents. The preparation before the meeting
was superior and the facilitation of our retreat was as near to
perfection as possible – knowing when to insert a comment or question
to get the group focused and back on track as well as knowing when to
the let the discussion evolve and grow. I look forward to working with
Aspen Leadership Group in the future for this type of work as well as
other assignments.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— James Gandre, President, Manhattan School of Music</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It was one of the most pleasant searches I have been involved in, and
I give everyone who took part in the process kudos.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Mike Stoll, candidate placed at the Aspen Music Festival and School</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Aspen Leadership Group took the time to meet with our entire
management team in order to understand our needs clearly and
thoroughly. ALG’s expertise in identifying the best industry talent
led to the hiring of an extremely qualified candidate whom we are
confident will take our program to the next level. We couldn’t be
happier with the results achieved for the FWSO by the Aspen Leadership
Group!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Amy Adkins, President, Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Our president and I can’t thank the Aspen Leadership Group enough for
their partnership and support. Our board is thrilled with our progress
and with new approaches to talent management and fundraising developed
in consultation with Ron and Tim.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Steve Bergfeld, Senior Vice President for Advancement and Vice
President for Planning and Strategy, Loyola University Chicago</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Ron is uniquely well-suited as a strategic thought partner and
retreat facilitator. Drawing upon his many rich experiences in the
profession, he’s able to function very effectively as a master
teacher, yet he’s equally skilled at creating an inviting environment
for lively discussion. Our staff continued to talk about the retreat
Ron led for several weeks, and his ideas and perspectives still influence the
way we carry out the advancement function at Hendrix.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Dr. Kevin H. Braswell, Vice President for Development, Hendrix College</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Aspen Leadership Group’s insights into our programs and our
fundraising efforts have led us to restructure how we present the
Foundation and how we approach donors. We now more clearly express
what we have done, what we wish to do, and the roles that donors can
play in our joint success. The effect, to use a word we do not use
casually or frequently, has been transformational.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Jay Davis,  President, The Hertz Foundation</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Ron’s decades of experience in working with presidents and boards, as
an administrator and as a board member himself, combined with his
training as a musician, enable him to talk comfortably and
knowledgeably with leaders in our field.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Deborah F. Rutter, President, John F. Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts</p>
